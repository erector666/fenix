## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Created `CHANGELOG.md` to track all changes from this point forward.

### Removed
- Cleaned up the repository by deleting all non-essential files and folders, keeping only what is required to run the app (backend, frontend, database schema, public assets, config files, and scripts).
- Removed deployment guides, mobile/android folders, alternative deployment configs, notes, and other non-critical files.
